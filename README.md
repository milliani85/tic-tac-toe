**Tic Tac Toe Game**

This is a browser-based Tic Tac Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to mark the board with either "X" or "O" and checks for winning conditions.


**Game Instructions**

Two players take turns to place their marks on the 3x3 game board.

The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

If all the spaces on the board are filled and no player has won, the game is a tie.

The game can be restarted at any time by clicking the "Restart" button.


**Implementation**

This game uses a Gameboard object to store the state of the game board and Player objects to store the names and marks of the players. The game flow is controlled by a Game object.

The code is organized into modules and factories to minimize the use of global variables. The rendering of the game board is done through a JavaScript function that manipulates the DOM.


**Credits**

This game was developed as part of the Odin Project curriculum.
